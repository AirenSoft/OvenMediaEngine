	// Yes, this map will have a collision once per max_history_size. 
	// However, the default value of 9600 is a very large value, and collision packets 
	// with 9600 sequence number differences are very old packets. 
	// Since RTP packets have a creation time, old packets may not be used. 
	// This can avoid collision. Therefore, set max_history_size to a large value as possible.
