## Overview

Alert is a module that can detect anomalies and patterns of interest in a stream or system and send notifications to users. Anomalies and patterns of interest can be set through predefined , and when detected, the module sends an HTTP(S) request to the user's notification server.

## Configuration

Alert can be set up on `<Server>`, as shown below.

```xml
<Server version="8">
	<Alert>
		<Webhooks>
			<Webhook>
				<Url>http://192.168.0.161:9595/alert/notification</Url>
				<SecretKey>1234</SecretKey>
				<Timeout>3000</Timeout>
			</Webhook>
			<Webhook>
				<Url>http://192.168.0.162:9595/alert/notification</Url>
				<SecretKey>5678</SecretKey>
			</Webhook>
		</Webhooks>
		<Rules>
			<Ingress>
				<MinBitrate>2000000</MinBitrate>
				<MaxBitrate>4000000</MaxBitrate>

| Webhooks | A list of webhooks to receive the notifications. Notifications are sent to every `<Webhook>`.     |

### Webhook

| Key       | Description                                                                                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Url       | The HTTP Server to receive the notification. HTTP and HTTPS are available.                                                               |
| SecretKey | (Optional) The secret key used when encrypting with HMAC-SHA1<br />For more information, see <a href="alert.md#security">Security</a>.   |
| Timeout   | (Optional, Default: 3000) Time to wait for a response after request. (in milliseconds)                                                   |

:::warning
`<Url>`, `<SecretKey>` and `<Timeout>` set directly under `<Alert>` are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. During the deprecation period they still work as a single webhook. Please use `<Webhooks>` instead.
:::

:::info
Notifications are sent to each webhook sequentially, and a request that fails at the connection level (e.g. connection timeout or network error) is retried up to 2 times. An HTTP error response (a status code other than 200) is not retried. A webhook that responds slowly or is unreachable therefore delays delivery to the webhooks after it. To keep alert delivery healthy:

* Prefer an IP address for `<Url>`, or a hostname whose DNS server is reliable — the hostname is resolved on every request and DNS resolution is not covered by `<Timeout>`.
* Do not set `<Timeout>` to `0`, which means waiting for a response indefinitely.

Here is a detailed explanation of each element of JSON payload:

| Element    | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| serverInfo | Information identifying the server that sent the notification. This is useful for distinguishing alerts when multiple OvenMediaEngine instances report to the same notification server.<br />`serverID`: Unique ID of the server. It is generated when the server first starts and is persisted in the `Server.id` file in the configuration directory. The configuration directory must be writable for the ID to remain stable across restarts; otherwise (e.g. a read-only ConfigMap mount on Kubernetes) a new ID is generated at every startup.<br />`serverName`: The value of `<Server><Name>` in the configuration. Omitted if not set.<br />`hostname`: The OS hostname of the machine running OvenMediaEngine. On Kubernetes this is the pod name, and on Docker it is the container ID unless `--hostname` is specified. Omitted in the rare case that the hostname cannot be retrieved from the OS.<br />`ipAddresses`: IP addresses of the server, captured at server startup. The public IP addresses resolved from `<StunServer>` (if configured) come first, followed by the local interface addresses (excluding loopback and IPv6 link-local addresses). Omitted when no address is available. |
| sourceUri  | URI information of the detected source.<br />`INGRESS`: #&#x3C;vhost>#&#x3C;application>/&#x3C;input_stream>                                                                      |
| messages   | List of messages detected by the Rules.                                                                                                                                           |
| sourceInfo | Detailed information about the source, captured when the notification is sent. It is the stream `name` plus the fields of the `input` object in the [Stream REST API](rest-api/v1/virtualhost/application/stream/README.md#get-stream-info) response, at the top level, so it also includes `connection`. For a WebRTC source, `connection` is present only after ICE has selected a candidate pair, so the notification sent when the stream is created normally does not have it yet, while later ones do. A later ICE candidate pair switch changes the value returned by the REST API and is reflected in later notifications, but does not trigger a notification of its own. |
| type       | It represents the format of the JSON payload. The information of the JSON elements can vary depending on the value of the type.                                                   |

#### Security

The control server may need to validate incoming http requests for security reasons. To do this, the Alert module puts the `X-OME-Signature` value in the HTTP request header. `X-OME-Signature` is a base64 url safe encoded value obtained by encrypting the payload of an HTTP request with the HMAC-SHA1 algorithm using the secret key set in `<Alert><SecretKey>` of the configuration.

### Response

The engine in the closing state does not need any parameter in response. The response payload is ignored.
