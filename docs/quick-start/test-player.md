## OvenSpace

OvenSpace offers a fast and easy way to experience the powerful tools of OvenMediaEngine, OvenPlayer, and OvenLiveKit in action.

With OvenSpace, you can quickly and easily stream content with sub-second latency using WebRTC technology, or take advantage of Apple's LLHLS specification to deliver low-latency live streaming. The platform allows you to stream from various sources, including your webcam, microphone, screen, or an external live encoder that supports RTMP and SRT.

OvenSpace is available online, so you can try it out for yourself at [https://space.ovenplayer.com/](https://space.ovenplayer.com/). You'll get a hands-on experience of how OvenMediaEngine, OvenPlayer, and OvenLiveKit work together seamlessly to deliver top-quality streaming, whether you're a developer looking to build a media service or someone who wants to experience sub-second or low-latency streaming firsthand.

OvenSpace is also available on [Github](https://github.com/AirenSoft/OvenSpace) as open source. It will be a good reference when developing media services using OvenMediaEngine, OvenPlayer and OvenLiveKit.
