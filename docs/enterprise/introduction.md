# Introduction

The Enterprise Edition of OvenMediaEnigne has been released to provide commercial codecs. The Enterprise version is distributed for a fee because it has a commercial codec installed, and you must agree to the EULA to use it.

In addition, it provides valuable features to managers in a commercial environment, such as the Web Console, and some additional functions not available in the Community Edition of OvenMediaEngine.

All features of OvenMediaEngine are identical to the Open Source version and the Enterprise version, with the following exceptions.

Enterprise adds:

* Commercial library
* The features that the customer does not allow to be disclosed as open source among the features developed by the customer commissioned by AirenSoft.
