# Low-Latency DASH and Legacy HLS streaming

{% hint style="danger" %}
From OvenMediaEngine v0.14.0, updates to legacy HLS, DASH, and LLDASH are now discontinued. These will be **deprecated**.
{% endhint %}

LLHLS, released from v0.14.0, is superior to Dash and LLDASH in all aspects of compatibility, performance and function, and also support legacy HLS players. Therefore, we decided not to update legacy HLS, DASH and LLDASH anymore. With the energy that was used to maintain these features, we will focus on more wonderful features in the future.



#### For legacy HLS, DASH, and LLDASH, refer to the old version manual.
