# Getting Started with OME Docker Launcher

## Overview and Features

The OME Docker Launcher is a tool that simplifies the process of deploying and managing the OvenMediaEngine (OME) application using Docker containers. This tool can be used by developers and system administrators who want to quickly deploy and test the OME application in a Docker environment.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The OME Docker Launcher provides a set of commands that allow users to easily manage the OME Docker container. These commands include:

* [`setup`](getting-started-with-ome-docker-launcher.md#setup)
  * This command pulls the OME Docker image(`airensoft/ovenmediaengine:latest`) from the Docker registry and copies the necessary configuration files to a specified location. This command needs to be run before starting the OME Docker container.
* [`start`](getting-started-with-ome-docker-launcher.md#start)
  * This command creates and starts the Docker container. Once the container is started, the OME application can be accessed through a web browser using the container's IP address.
* [`sh`](getting-started-with-ome-docker-launcher.md#sh)
  * This command launches a bash shell inside the running OME Docker container, allowing users to execute commands and interact with the container.
* [`status`](getting-started-with-ome-docker-launcher.md#status)
  * This command displays the status of the running OME Docker container, including information such as the container name, and running status.
* [`stop`](getting-started-with-ome-docker-launcher.md#stop)
  * This command stops the running OME Docker container.
* [`restart`](getting-started-with-ome-docker-launcher.md#restart)
  * This command stops and then starts the OME Docker container.

Using the OME Docker Launcher, you can easily set up and manage an OME Docker container, without having to manually configure and manage the Docker container. This can save time and effort, especially for users who are not familiar with Docker or who do not want to spend time manually setting up and configuring the OME application.

OME Docker Launcher has not been tested in various environments yet. Therefore, sharing any issues that occur while using it is always welcome.

```bash
• Usage: ./ome_docker_launcher.sh [OPTIONS] COMMAND ...

• Options:
  -h, --help                        Show this help message and exit

  status      Show the status of the docker container
  stop        Stop the docker container
  restart     Restart the docker container
```

### `setup`

The `setup` command pulls the OME Docker image from the Docker registry and copies the necessary configuration files to the host's `/usr/share/ovenmediaengine` directory. Additionally, it initializes the log path and crash dump path that will be mounted into the container when it is run.

This command prepares the host environment for running the OME Docker container and sets up the necessary directories and configurations for the container to run correctly.

If you run the "setup" command, the following files and directories will be created:

* `/usr/share/ovenmediaengine/conf`
  * This directory contains the OME configuration files and is mounted into the container when it is run.
* `/usr/share/ovenmediaengine/logs`
  * This directory is the log path for OME and is mounted into the container when it is run. Log files generated by OME will be stored in this directory.
* `/usr/share/ovenmediaengine/dumps`
  * This directory is the crash dump path for OME and is mounted into the container when it is run. Crash dumps generated by OME will be stored in this directory.

```bash
$ ./ome_docker_launcher.sh setup

• Creating configuration directory /usr/share/ovenmediaengine/conf
• Copying configuration to /usr/share/ovenmediaengine/conf
• Copying logs directory
• Copying crash dump directory
• OvenMediaEngine is ready to start!

If you want to change the settings, please modify /usr/share/ovenmediaengine/conf/Server.xml
If you want to start OvenMediaEngine, please run ./ome_docker_launcher.sh start
```

If you want to change the configuration of OME, you can edit the `/usr/share/ovenmediaengine/conf/Server.xml` file. This file contains the server configuration settings for OME, such as the server's IP address, port, and SSL settings. Once you have made changes to this file, you will need to restart the OME Docker container for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the `restart` command provided by the OME Docker Launcher.

#### Certificate Installation

To install a certificate in OvenMediaEngine, copy the certificate files to /usr/share/ovenmediaengine/conf with the following names:

<table><thead><tr><th width="219">Type</th><th>File name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Certificate</td><td>cert.crt</td></tr><tr><td>Private Key</td><td>cert.key</td></tr><tr><td>CA Bundle</td><td>cert.ca-bundle</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you want to change the file names, you can modify Server.xml.

### `start`

Once the `setup` phase is complete, you can use the `start` command to run the OME Docker container. The `start` command creates and starts the Docker container, enabling the OME application to receive stream packets using protocols such as RTMP and SRT. Before running the `start` command, ensure that the necessary configuration files have been copied to the host's `/usr/share/ovenmediaengine` directory by running the `setup` command.

```bash
$ ./ome_docker_launcher.sh start

• OvenMediaEngine is started successfully!
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When running the OME Docker Launcher, you can specify the IP to be used as an ICE Candidate by using the `OME_HOST_IP` environment variable. For instance, specifying the `OME_HOST_IP` as shown below will propagate the ICE Candidate to that particular address.



```sh
$ OME_HOST_IP=1.2.3.4 ./ome_docker_launcher.sh start
...
• OvenMediaEngine is started successfully!

$ tail -f /usr/share/ovenmediaengine/logs/ovenmediaengine.log
...
[2023-11-01 00:00:00.000] I [OvenMediaEngine:1] ICE | ice_port_manager.cpp:305  | ICE candidate found: 1.2.3.4:40000
...
```
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The OME Docker Launcher automatically detects a list of port numbers specified in the `Server.xml` file and passes them to the Docker `-p` option. However, if you use the `include` attribute inside the `<Providers>` or `<Publishers>` element, the launcher may not detect them correctly.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have declared the following environment variable in the shell where you run the OME Docker Launcher, this value will be used to bind the port and passed into the Docker container. This enables you to dynamically set configuration values using environment variables.

```
OME_HOST_IP
OME_RTMP_PROV_PORT
OME_WEBRTC_CANDIDATE_IP
OME_WEBRTC_CANDIDATE_PORT
OME_WEBRTC_SIGNALLING_PORT
OME_WEBRTC_SIGNALLING_TLS_PORT
OME_WEBRTC_TCP_RELAY_PORT
```
{% endhint %}

### `sh`

The `sh` command allows you to enter into the shell of the running container. You can use this command for troubleshooting purpose. Once you enter into the container's shell, you can execute any commands just like you do in a normal Linux shell. This allows you to inspect the container's internal state and debug any issues that you might be facing with the container or the application running inside it.

```bash
$ ./ome_docker_launcher.sh sh

### `status`

The `status` command shows the current execution status of the container. If the container is running, it displays the ID and name of the container. This command helps you to verify whether the container is up and running or not. If the container is not running, you can use the `start` command to start the container.

```bash
$ ./ome_docker_launcher.sh status

### `stop`

The `stop` command stops the running container and removes it from the list of Docker containers.&#x20;

## Troubleshootings

### Enable debug log

If you encounter any problems during the execution, try using the `-d` option in the `[OPTIONS]` to view detailed logs. This option shows the command sets and their results that are executed internally.

```bash
$ ./ome_docker_launcher.sh -d stop

 └── Succeeded

 ┌── /usr/bin/docker rm ovenemediaengine
   docker> ovenemediaengine
 └── Succeeded
• OvenMediaEngine is stopped successfully
```

### Get the crash dump of OME in the container

If OME terminates abnormally, providing the crash dump to the OME team can be helpful. The crash dump is stored in the `/usr/share/ovenmediaengine/dumps` directory, which is created during the `setup` phase. You can find the dump file named `crash_<yyyymmdd>.dump` in this directory.

Sharing those log and dump file would be greatly appreciated and helpful for the development of OME.
